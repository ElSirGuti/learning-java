# learning-java
Ok so let's explain almost every file here, I'll try to keep this README updated

So first of all I'm trying to learn java basics in 5-6 days with this youtube playlist https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLyvsggKtwbLX9LrDnl1-K6QtYo7m0yXWB
then I'll move on onto this one that is more advanced https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLyvsggKtwbLXEZjb8HrNTbWesTKIfpNak
maybe I can make it in 10 days more or less

Quick explanatory
"Dia" stands for Day in spanish and "C" is for abbreviating "Class"
so "dian" means Day N and "cn" means "Class N" (N is any number)
So quick index
1. dia1c1: Hola Mundo (Hello World)
2. dia1c2: Tipos de Datos y Variables (Data Type and Variables)
3. dia2c1: Operadores aritm√©ticos y prioridad de los signos (Arithmetic Operators and Sign Priority)
